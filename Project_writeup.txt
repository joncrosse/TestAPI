Project_writeup.pdf shall have the following information:

    Your name
    Your team name
    Your team size
    Your team's project URL, like:  http://paul.cs.uky.edu:9990
    All team members names, including yours.  Next to each name put you opinion the percentage each team member contributed to the project.  Needless to say, the numbers should add up to 100%.  NOTE: if there is a difference in the amounts, or they are skewed, then I will schedule Zoom interviews with each team member.  If a 4 person team has 2 or 3 say they did all the work and the other 1 or 2 did little to none, then grades will be weighted accordingly.
    1 or 2 sentences on your contribution to the project.
    All sources other than what has been provided.  This is an individual project, teams should not be collaborating with other teams.
    A table of endpoints: 9 rows by 2 columns.
        Each endpoint in the same order as they are listed above, like "/api/createuser".
        Status of each endpoint's development: 
            NONE,
            PLACEHOLDER ("status":"-5", "error":"not yet implemented", etc),
            PARTIAL,
            COMPLETE.
    If you did not use the starter code, you must provide all source code to produce a running http RESTful API server.  For this requirement you can put "Starter code/IntelliJ used", or describe what you used like "Ruby on Rails", or "Python with XYZ".
        If you did not use the starter code you need to provide either a Makefile (and state how to invoke it) or STEP BY STEP instructions on how to run your server.

Our team used Ruby on Rails to create a RESTful API server.

How to run our server:

1. Make sure you have Ruby / Ruby On Rails installed
2. Open terminal and navigate to inside of 'RailServer' directory
3. Run command 'Rails s' to start server
4. You can then open a new terminal to make curl / API calls to the server
